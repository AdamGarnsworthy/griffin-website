                        <p class='splashText'>GRIFFIN is designed for decay spectroscopy, the study of the radiation emitted when radioactive nuclei decay. Our facility supports a broad spectrum of research in three major fields: in nuclear structure, GRIFFIN helps understand how the properties of nuclei change based on their composition; in nuclear astrophysics, it studies nuclei along the r-process path (thought to be the mechanism for how the heavy chemical elements are formed in the universe); and in fundamental symmetries, it performs precision studies of super-allowed fermi beta decays in a particular subset of nuclei that have the same number of protons and neutrons, as well as measurements for the Radon Electric Dipole Moment program at ISAC. </p>

                        <p><b>Process:</b> A nucleus in an excited state loses energy by passing it to an atomic electron and ejecting it from the atom. The energy of the electron is equal to the transition energy minus the binding energy of the atomic orbital from which it came. Internal conversion can occur in any nucleus on the nuclear chart but is more common in heavy nuclei above lead. An alternative process for the nucleus to lose energy is &gamma; emission.</p>
